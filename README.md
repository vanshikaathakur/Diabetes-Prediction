Diabetes Prediction using SVM
This project is a machine learning model that predicts whether a person has diabetes or not based on a set of health-related parameters. It uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

Overview
The Jupyter Notebook Diabetes Prediction.ipynb follows a standard machine learning workflow:

Data Loading: The notebook loads a dataset containing various health metrics and a target variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

Data Preprocessing: The features are standardized using StandardScaler from the scikit-learn library. This step is crucial as it helps the SVM algorithm perform optimally by ensuring all features contribute equally to the model.

Model Training: A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained on the preprocessed data.

Prediction: The trained model is used to make a prediction on a new data instance, determining if the person is diabetic.

Dependencies
To run this notebook, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

How to Run
Make sure you have all the required dependencies installed.

Open the Diabetes Prediction.ipynb file in a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code with the Python extension).

Run the cells sequentially to execute the entire workflow, from data loading to making a prediction.
